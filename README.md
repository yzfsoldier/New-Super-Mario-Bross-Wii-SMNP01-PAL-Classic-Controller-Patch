# New-Super-Mario-Bross-Wii-SMNP01-PAL-Classic-Controller-Patch
This is a modified Port from the Classic Controller Code from the Newer Team (Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii) for the Vanilla Version (SMNP01 / PAL) of the Game.
You can permanently patch the main.dol executable with Wiimms wstrt (you need to compile the complete_injection.gecko to a .gct File for that purpose).
For normal runtime patching like via Dolphin (tested) or with a USB Loader on a real Wii use the complete.gecko File.
Sadly this Modification won't work with the Wii U Gamepad when injected as a Wii Game. I tried both normal Classic Controller and Force Classic Controller Options in TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector, both with the same result.
